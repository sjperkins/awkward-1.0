# Contributing to Awkward Array

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We're eager to see your ideas and look forward to working with you.

This document describes the technical procedures we follow in this project. I should also stress that as members of the Scikit-HEP community, we are all obliged to maintaining a welcoming, harassment-free environment. See the [Code of Conduct](https://scikit-hep.org/code-of-conduct) for details.

### Where to start

The front page for the Awkward Array project is its [GitHub README](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0#readme). This leads directly to tutorials and reference documentation that I assume you've already seen. It also includes instructions for [compiling for development](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0#installation-for-developers), using the localbuild.py script.

### Reporting issues

The first thing you should do if you want to fix something is to [submit an issue through GitHub](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues). That way, we can all see it and maybe I or a member of the community knows of a solution that could save you the time spent fixing it. If you want to "own" the issue, you can signal your intent to fix it in the issue report.

### Contributing a pull request

Feel free to [open pull requests in GitHub](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/pulls) from your forked repo when you start working on the problem. I recommend opening the pull request early so that we can see your progress and communicate about it. (Note that you can `git commit --allow-empty` to make an empty commit and start a pull request before you even have new code.)

Please [make the pull request a draft](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) to indicate that it is in an incomplete state and shouldn't be merged until you click "ready for review."

At present, I (Jim Pivarski, [jpivarski](https://github.com/jpivarski)) merge or close all pull requests for Awkward Array, though a team of maintainers should be enlisted in the future, as the project matures. When I'm working closely with a developer, such as a summer student, I'll sometimes give that developer permission to merge their own pull requests.

If you're waiting for me to review, comment upon, or merge a pull request, please do remind me by mentioning me (`@jpivarski`) in a comment. It's possible that I've forgotten and I apologize in advance. (I tend to give the person I'm currently working with my full attention, unfortunately at the expense of others.)

### Becoming a regular committer

If you want to contribute frequently, I'll grant you write access to the `scikit-hep/awkward-1.0` repo itself. This is more convenient than pull requests from forked repos because I can contribute corrections to your branch in fewer steps.

### Git practices

That said, most of the commits on a pull request/git branch should be from a single author. Corrections or suggestions from other authors are exceptional cases, when a particular change is easier to express as a code diff than in words.

As such, you should name your branch starting with your GitHub userid and a slash, such as `jpivarski/write-contributing-md`. If you start a pull request with a branch that doesn't follow convention, though, you don't need to fix it.

Most pull requests are merged with the "squash and merge" feature, so details about commit history within a pull request are lost. Feel free, therefore, to commit with any frequency you're comfortable with. I like to make frequent commits to avoid losing work to a dead laptop, and to have more save-points to recover from.

It is unnecessary to manually edit (rebase) your commit history. If, however, you do want to save a pull request as multiple commits on `master`, ask me and we'll discuss.

### Building and teseting locally

As described in [the README](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0#installation-for-developers), you can build locally using

```bash
python localbuild.py --pytest tests
```

The `--pytest tests` runs the integration tests from the `tests` directory (drop it to build only).

For more fine-grained testing, we also have tests of the low-level kernels, which can be invoked with

```bash
python dev/generate-kernelspec.py
python dev/generate-tests.py
python -m pytest -vv -rs tests-spec
python -m pytest -vv -rs tests-cpu-kernels
```

Furthermore, if you have an Nvidia GPU, you can build and locally install the experimental CUDA plug-in with

```bash
pip uninstall -y awkward1-cuda-kernels
python dev/generate-cuda.py
./cuda-build.sh --install
```

The `--install` does a local `pip install` on your system, which is the only way to use it. You can run its tests with

```bash
python dev/generate-tests.py
python -m pytest -vv -rs tests-cuda-kernels
python -m pytest -vv -rs tests-cuda
```

### Building documentation locally

We use [Sphinx](https://pypi.org/project/Sphinx/) to generate documentation.  

You need some additional packages installed on your system to build the documentation - 
* [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html)
* [pycparser](https://pypi.org/project/pycparser/)
* [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/)
* [sphinx](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx/)
* [sphinx-rtd-theme](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-rtd-theme/)

To build documentation locally, execute the following command from the root directory of the project.

```bash
sphinx-build docs-sphinx docs-sphinx/_build
```

this command executes multiple custom Python scripts(some require a working internet connection), in addition to using Sphinx and Doxygen to generate the required browser viewable documentation.

To view the built documentation, open

```bash
docs-sphinx/_build/index.html
```

from the root directory of the project in your preferred web browser.

Before re-building documentation, you might want to delete the files that were generated to create viewable documentation. A simple command to remove all of them is

```bash
rm -rf docs-shinx/_auto docs_sphinx/_build docs-sphinx/_static
```

### Continuous integration

Pull requests must pass all [continuous integration](https://dev.azure.com/jpivarski/Scikit-HEP/_build?definitionId=3&_a=summary) tests before they are merged. I will sometimes cancel non-essential builds to give priority to pull requests that are almost ready to be merged. If you needed the result of the build as a diagnostic, you can ask me to restart your job or make a trivial change to trigger a new build.

Currently, we only run merge builds (the state of your branch if merged with master), not regular branch builds (the state of your branch as-is), because only merge builds can be made to run for pull requests from external forks and it makes better use of our limited execution time on Azure. If you want to enable regular branch builds, you can turn it on for your branch by editing `trigger/branches/exclude` in [.ci/azure-buildtest-awkwrad.yml](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/blob/9b6fca3f6e6456860ae40979171f762e0045ce7c/.ci/azure-buildtest-awkward.yml#L1-L5). The merge build trigger is not controlled by the YAML file. It is better, however, to keep up-to-date with `git merge master`.

### Semi-automated testing of CUDA kernels

For development on the cuda-kernels, an AWS VM with a GPU has been set up to run tests in the `tests-cuda` directory. You can email jpivarski at GMail for more information on how to get permissions to launch the AWS instance.

To see if the AWS instance is running, use the launcher:

```bash
% ssh -i ~/.ssh/awkward1-cuda-test.pem ubuntu@WW.XX.YY.ZZ ./list-instances.py
i-0295dd31185ce78f7     WW.XX.YY.ZZ    running ['launcher']
i-0a1ec83c261607797     AA.BB.CC.DD    running ['awkward1-cuda-test']
i-0a9dd553fe19610fb          (none)    stopped ['awkward1-cuda-test-2gpus']
```

If it is `stopped`, launch it with:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/awkward1-cuda-test.pem ubuntu@WW.XX.YY.ZZ aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-0a1ec83c261607797
```

Once it's `running`, use its IP address (`AA.BB.CC.DD`) to run the tests for your branch (`my-branch-name`):

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/awkward1-cuda-test.pem ubuntu@AA.BB.CC.DD ./cuda-run-tests.sh my-branch-name
```

When you are done, be sure to put it back into the `stopped` state:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/awkward1-cuda-test.pem ubuntu@WW.XX.YY.ZZ aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids i-0a1ec83c261607797
```

and verify with `list-instances`. While the GPU instance is running, you can ssh into it interactively for debugging.

### The master branch

The Awkward Array `master` branch must be kept in an unbroken state. Although the recommended way to install Awkward Array is through pip or conda, the `master` branch on GitHub must always be functional. Pull requests for bug fixes and new features are based on `master`, so it has to work for users to test our proposed changes.

The `master` branch is also never far from the latest released version. The [release history](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_auto/changelog.html) shows that each release introduces at most several, sometimes only one, completed pull requests.

Committing directly to `master` is not allowed except for

   * updating the `VERSION_INFO` file, which should be independent of pull requests
   * updating documentation or non-code files
   * unprecedented emergencies

and only by me.

### Releases

Similarly, only I publish releases (or a team of maintainers, in the future). Publishing releases starts the deployment procedure, updating the package that users will get when they pip-install.

As stated above, new releases are published frequently, getting bug fixes and new features to users almost continuously. We prefer this over "big bang" releases with many changes.

## Project organization

The Awkward Array codebase consists of three main layers: the high-level user interface (in Python), data ownership and navigation (independently in C++ and lowered Numba), and array manipulation (in C++ and CUDA, behind a pure C interface).

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs-img/diagrams/awkward-1-0-layers.png" width="600">
</p>

Contributing to each part of the codebase has a different flavor:

   * The high-level code is focused on user experience, with careful attention to names, backward compatibility, duck typing, and interfaces with external libraries. Parts of it are more docstring than code.
   * The C++ code is focused on correct memory management and navigating data structures. It is *not* the place for performance optimizations, at least not unless motivated by specific metrics.
   * The Numba code requires familiarity with [Numba's extension mechanism](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/extending/index.html) (low-level only) and Numba internals.
   * The CPU kernels and GPU kernels are two implementations of the same functions, optimized for CPUs and GPUs, respectively. The pure C interface to these functions, and most of their implementations, involve only numbers and arrays. This *is* the place for performance optimizations.

A Contribution might only touch one layer of the code or it might involve more than one.

### Deployment products

Awkward Array consists of two (or three) shared libraries,

   * `libawkward-cpu-kernels.so` (or `.dylib`, etc.)
   * `libawkward-cuda-kernels.so` (if compiled with CUDA support)
   * `libawkward.so`

and a Python library shipped as binary wheels or (in rare cases) a source tarball to be compiled. The pip and conda deployments include all shared libraries with the Python package and put C++ headers in the system-dependent location for `includes`, in a directory named `awkward`.

### Performance considerations

The conventional model is that Python is for a good user interface and C++ is for performance. In the case of Awkward Array, even the C++ layer is not intended for high performance; this is pushed down to the CPU and GPU kernels. See the "[how-it-works tutorials for developers](https://scikit-hep.org/awkward-1.0/how-it-works.html)" for more on columnar data, but in typical applications, the number of C++ objects is small (hundreds to thousands of instances) while the size of array buffers sent to CPU and GPU kernels is large (billions of elements).

Thus, we freely take advantage of some "old" C++ practices that sacrifice performance for flexibility:

   * dynamic dispatch (virtual methods) instead of template specialization
   * copy constructors and naive argument passing instead of move semantics.

The CPU and GPU kernels, on the other hand, should be optimized for hardware cache throughput and vectorization. Performance improvements in CPU and GPU kernels are eagerly sought, while performance improvements in the C++ codebase have to be justified by significant gains.

Sometimes, changes in the C++ or even Python code can change the number or size of CPU and GPU kernels that need to be run, in which case they are easily justified performance corrections.

To ensure this separation between "slow control" and "fast math," Python and C++ code are not allowed to perform any loops over data in array buffers. Only CPU and GPU kernels are allowed to do that. In fact, C++ is not even allowed to access values pointed to by these arrays, as the pointer might be in main memory or it might be a device pointer on a GPU. (Dereferencing such a pointer as though it were in main memory would cause a segmentation fault.)

### Priorities

As we change the code, we should keep in mind the following priorities, in this order (from most important to "nice to have"):

   1. Operations must give correct results. Awkward Array is basically a math library, and for our chosen interpretation of the data structures as mathematical objects and operations as functions, there is a right answer. Silently returning the wrong answer is worse than crashing.
   2. When used in Python, it must not raise segmentation faults. Python users expect to freely use software without ever encountering a segmentation fault (or other signal/behavior that aborts the Python shell). "Crashes" are indications that something is seriously wrong. Exceptions, however, are normal and expected. We use `ValueError` (`std::invalid_argument` in C++) to indicate that the user has provided wrong input and `RuntimeError` (`std::runtime_error` in C++) to indicate an internal error. The latter is a bug, but the user is informed of the bug in a useful way.
   3. The separation between "slow control" and "fast math" must be maintained. No Python or C++ loops over array buffer data: all of that must be contained within CPU and GPU kernels or NumPy and CuPy calls in Python. The only exceptions are for converting from and to non-columnar data structures (e.g. `ak.from_iter` and `ak.to_list`). This rule is motivated by performance (see the section above), but it is an objective, categorical rule that enables CPU/GPU interchangeability, not a slippery slope of fine-tuning.
   4. Python-friendly interface. This library is intended for data analysts who want to focus on data without being interrupted by technical complications. The front-end should be as simple as possible, but no simpler: inherent mathematical features should be foremost, even if they are complex, but computing-related complexity should not. This criterion can usually be satisfied independently of the others.
   5. NumPy compatibility. Every function that generalizes a NumPy function is unified with it (using [NEP 13](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0013-ufunc-overrides.html) and [NEP 18](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0018-array-function-protocol.html)) and behaves identically for the same input data.
   6. Readability and maintainability. Awkward Array is a long-term project that can't afford to accrue technical debt.
   7. Performance tuning. Ultimately, the reason data analysts use Awkward Array, rather than writing for loops, is speed. It's usually an orders-of-magnitude difference thanks to the separation between "slow control" and "fast math," but there may be cases where explicit tuning is warranted.

### General statements on coding style

Above all, the purpose of any programming language is to be read by humans; if we were only concerned with operating the machine, we would be flipping individual bits. It should be organized in stanzas that highlight similarities and differences by grouping them on the screen.

We adhere to an 80-character line width, which is a [standard in the industry](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/pull/183), despite the fact that we don't write punch-cards anymore. The standardized width allows several window columns to be examined side-by-side. Exceptions to the 80-character limit follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/): we don't split URLs or similar tokens that must be read as a unit.

Unit tests do not need to adhere to the 80-character limit.

We don't, however, use automated formatters like clang-format or black. Automated formatting can rearrange code into something that is, paradoxically, harder to read, undermining the human element in programming.

We don't currently use linters like clang-tidy or flake8, but I'm open to it.

#### Contributing to files in src/cpu-kernels/

Avoid using [Python keywords](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords) in files residing inside `src/cpu-kernels/`

#### Contributing to files in include/awkward/cpu-kernels/

Make sure to prepend each function definition with -
```
/// @param param1 inparam/outparam (optional role: rolename)
/// @param param2 inparam/outparam (optional role: rolename)
/// @param param3 inparam/outparam (optional role: rolename)
....
```

### Fully qualified names

We don't import names in C++ (`using`) or Python (`import from`) so that it's easy to see where objects come from and find all instances with a text search. This is sometimes in tension with the 80-character limit.

In C++, `using awkward as ak` and `using pybind11 as py` are standard shorthands. For end-users, `import awkward1 as ak` is recommended, but not in the codebase (including unit tests). We also don't use `import numpy as np` in the codebase, even though it is common in scripts.

### Compiler warnings

We should strive to eliminate all compiler warnings, including Linux (GCC), MacOS (Clang), and Windows (Visual Studio) builds on continuous integration. Warnings from other compilers and on other platforms have revealed bugs during Awkward Array's development.

It can, however, be difficult to diagnose errors that only show up in continuous integration. Most of the Windows errors and warnings have been related to 32-bit tests, which can be reproduced using 32-bit Linux in Docker images (getting dependencies from 32-bit conda). Most of the MacOS warnings have been related to symbol visibility and Clang specifics, which can also be emulated on other systems with access to a Clang compiler.

The insistence on eliminating compiler warnings, however, begs the question of "with which warnings enabled?" I have not answered this question (using only the default settings of GCC), but I would be welcome to suggestions.

### C++ standard

We use the C++11 version of the language, as it is a minimum required for pybind11 and a maximum allowed on the manylinux Docker images that compile the Python extension modules in a portable way.

As stated above, most of the C++ features we use are "old," such as virtual inheritance. We strive for simple code, rather than "smart" code, and the sweet spot for C++ is shared pointers (not raw pointers) and runtime program flow (not template metaprogramming).

A quick scan of the code would reveal that we make extensive use of `std::shared_ptr`. Raw pointers are used in extremely limited circumstances, and never passed out of the scope that holds a shared pointer to the same resource (guaranteeing its lifetime). The main use of raw pointers is for down-casting with `dynamic_cast`.

Class instances are passed between functions as generic types for flexibility. For example, `toListOffsetArray64` returns a list array converted to the `ListOffsetArray64` class, but it is passed as a smart pointer to the common superclass, `Content`. This is because passing as a `ListOffsetArray64` exposes typeinfo symbols that violate visibility rules.

Class hierarchies are intentionally simple. If any inheritance is involved, the one superclass is abstract and all subclasses are direct children of that abstract superclass.

Templating is only used for integer specialization.

### Python standard

We target Python 2.7 and recent versions of Python 3, currently starting with 3.5 (though that may move up to 3.6).

We only supprt Python 2.7 as much as is practical. For example, we ignore compiler warnings when compiling against Python 2.7 and any unit tests that depend on the difference are skipped for Python 2.7.

Python 2.7 and 3.5 have unstable dict order, which excludes them both from some tests.

Allowing Python 2.7 after it has been [fully and finally discontinued](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-dev@python.org/message/OFCIETIXLX34X7FVK5B5WPZH22HXV342/) may sound anachronistic, but some of our users depend on legacy codebases forcing them in Python 2, and Python 2 limits our adoption of new language features, keeping the code "simple, rather than smart."

### Third party dependencies

Awkward Array's C++ codebase only depends on pybind11 and rapidjson, which are both header-only and included as git submodules (the reason for the `git clone --recursive`).

The Python codebase only strictly depends on NumPy 1.13.1, the first version with [NEP 13](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0013-ufunc-overrides.html). This fixes the minimum Python at 2.7.

Other third party libraries are used if they exist (can be imported), and we only accept certain versions of these libraries. Both the test-import and any version-testing must be within runtime code, not startup code, so that they're only invoked when users explicitly call for the feature that requires them.

Versions can be explicitly tested with `distutils.version.LooseVersion`, though it's better to test for features (existence of classes, methods, and attributes) than to test for explicit version numbers.

### Array object details

Arrays are (or soon will be: [#176](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/176) and [#177](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/177)) immutable objects. Only the high-level `ak.Array` changes its state in-place in response to user choices (such as `__setitem__`, which replaces its `layout` using the pure function `ak.with_field`). This is not a performance liability but usually a benefit because it means that we can freely share data among array objects without worrying about long-distance modifications.

Users can break this model by wrapping NumPy arrays as Awkward Arrays and changing the original NumPy arrays in-place, but they are encouraged not to.

An Awkward Array has distributed state: index arrays refer to positions in content arrays that might not exist. The validity of these relationships are checked as late as possible, i.e. an index position is checked to ensure that it is not outside of its content just before fetching that content.

This is motivated by performance: if bounds checking is performed when an element is needed, then the index has to be in CPU cache/a register anyway, whereas a separate validity-checking pass would flush caches. Also, some operations on valid arrays can be guaranteed to produce valid arrays as results, and there is no reason to re-check. (Mathematical guarantees on validity have not been explored.)

Most objects are defined by a small set of named fields (such as `starts`, `stops`, and `content` for a ListArray). In both C++ and Python, constructors take the full set of fields, the fields are stored as private members, and there are public accessors to those attributes, all with the same names. This ensures that the fields are immutable and resembles Scala's "case class" pattern for functional programming.

Within the narrow scope of a function, there is no attempt to maintain immutability.

------------

Thanks again for contributing to Awkward Array. We all look forward to what you have to add.

Cheers, and I wish you good craftsmanship!
